## Overview

This repository provides customised tools based on the original [Geekgineer/ros2_bag_exporter](https://github.com/Geekgineer/ros2_bag_exporter) project, tailored specifically for the University of Edinburgh's Autonomous Vehicle project.

The repository includes tools and a Docker environment for reading and exporting sensor data from ROS 2 bag files, facilitating data post-processing outside the ROS 2 ecosystem.

For general-purpose functionality, please refer to the original repository linked above.
